# Maxbox-Audio-Controller
Max 7 Patch for controlling audio with an Xbox 360 or Xbox One Controller. Uses karma patch from Rodrigo Costanzo and Xbox Controller Patch from Vincent Rieuf.
Programming: Andrew Zhou
GUI Design: Matthew Castillo

Patch allows manipulation of up to four separate sound files. Using the controller, the audio can be paused or resumed, pitch shifted, or reset to play from the start, and volume can be adjusted. Each of the four audio files can be individually muted, and the audio can also be recorded using the integrated karma patch. The recorded audio can be sped up or slowed down, and the recording window and position can be adjusted using the control sticks.
