Patch allows manipulation of up to four separate sound files using an XBox 360 or XBox One controller (XBox controller may recquire additional setup before Max will recognize it). The controller can be used to paused or resume the audio(Start), pitch shift the audio(Right C. Stick), reset to play from the start(Select), or adjust volume(Shoulder buttons). Each of the four audio files can be individually muted(D-pad), and the audio can also be recorded using the integrated karma patch by using the face buttons(XBYA). The recorded audio can be sped up or slowed down using the shoulder triggers, and the recording window and position can be adjusted using the control sticks.
